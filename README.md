# GCalSwitcher for Tampermonkey
 
A small TamperMonkey script that automatically switches to a different Google Calendar Account. 

For example, I use the Clarkson University calendar on my Clarkson account so I can see classes and assignments. It gets annoying when I load Google Calendar and it loads a different account, so this script will automatically switch to the Clarkson account when I load Google Calendar.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
2. Open the raw script file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NelsonDane/GCalSwitcher/main/gcal.js).
3. Open the Tampermonkey dashboard and click the "Create a new script..." button.
4. Paste the contents of the raw script file into the new script.
